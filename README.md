Welcome to the ChurnPredictor repository!

### About
This repository contains a machine learning project developed during an internship at Codeway Solutions. The project focuses on predicting customer churn using logistic regression, helping businesses identify customers who are likely to leave. The data analysis and model training were performed using Spyder.

### Project Highlights:
- **Predictive Model:** Logistic Regression model trained on customer data to predict churn.
- **Feature Engineering:** Utilizes features like credit score, geography, gender, age, tenure, balance, number of products, credit card ownership, activity status, and estimated salary.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes standard scaling and encoding of categorical variables.
- **Internship Experience:** Developed during an internship at Codeway Solutions, providing hands-on experience in machine learning and data analysis.
- **Tool Used:** Data analysis and model training were conducted using Spyder.

### Usage:
Explore the ChurnPredictor repository to access code, documentation, and datasets related to customer churn prediction. The project includes detailed instructions on how to use the model and replicate the results.

### Directory Structure:
- **data:** Contains the datasets used for training and testing the model.
- **scripts:** Python scripts for data preprocessing and model evaluation.
- **models:** Serialized model files for deployment.
- **spyder_projects:** Spyder IDE project files and analysis scripts.
